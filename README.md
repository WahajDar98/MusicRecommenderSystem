# Music Recommender System

## Background
- 

## Overview


## Business Objective 
This will help users with a Spotify account to be able to listen to songs that are similar to what they are already listening to. This includes users who are indecisive or sometimes tired of what they have been listening to that need some new songs but also resonates with the kind of taste in music they already have. 

## Data
The datasets that I used were 5 files that were taken from Kaggle called "[Spotify dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vatsalmavani/spotify-dataset?select=data)" which I then merged together.

## Next Steps
If this project is worked on in the future, these next steps could be explored:

- Use more data from a website like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) where you can access their datasets. [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) 
- Using a [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/.) call.
- Deploying the final model function to a mobile app or web app like [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/) or [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)
